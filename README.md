# ReduxSimpleStarter

Interested in learning [Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)?
This repo is a forked from Stephen Grider's [original](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter) with my own customizations:

* added eslint support
* added .editorconfig
* upgraded react to 15.1.0
* added other modules used in the course. e.g. redux-promise, axios

### Getting Started

There are two methods for getting started with this repo.
